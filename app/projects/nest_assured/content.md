# Summary

## About
Deliverable for an Industrial Design Engineering project spread across 2 terms, encompassing user research, prototyping and the delivery of a final working product.

## Problem
Young adults with ADHD often over-plan to ensure keep structure in their day. Hence, forgetting essential items for their day can consequently exacerbate their condition and lead to feelings of negativity.

## Research
10 young adults with ADHD were interviewed, and a medical professional was consulted to ensure that the product being developed would be beneficial.

## Solution
A plug-and-play item tracking solution utilising ultra-high frequency RFID and ESP-NOW. We chose Google Nest as the company due to company values and aesthetics.
