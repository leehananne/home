Industrial design project aimed to help young adults with ADHD who struggle with forgetting essential items. After interviewing 6 users and a medical professional, a working plug-and-play item tracker using ultra-high frequency RFID and ESP-NOW technology was developed, branded as a Google Nest solution.

*Google was not engaged in any consultancy or collaborative capacity with this project and the outcome is in no way endorsed by them. Any publicity is limited to personal and academic use.*
